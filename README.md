# dbt-semantic-interfaces

This repo contains the shared semantic classes, default validation, and tests designed to be used by both the dbt-core and MetricFlow projects. By centralizing these shared resources, we aim to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication across both projects.

## Features
- Protocols for shared semantic classes: Define the interfaces and common attributes that must be implemented by the objects in both projects.
- Validation: Ensure that the objects comply with the expected structure and constraints.
- Tests: Ensure that the objects' behavior is consistent and correct across both projects.
