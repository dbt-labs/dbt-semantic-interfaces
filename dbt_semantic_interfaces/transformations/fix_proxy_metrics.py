    Currently, we allow users to set an expr on simple metrics that just references a measure.
    This is technically allowed in the spec, but we don't actually use it to do anything as
    the expr that gets rendered will always be the referenced measure's expr. With the migration
    to the new spec where measures are removed, we are now using the metric.expr field to render
    the SQL. However, this ends up breaking old specs where the metric.expr is now being rendered
    which causes unexpected changes. This transformation will just set the expr to the measure expr
    if it exists to conform with the current behaviour.
